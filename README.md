# Kindle Highlights Extractor

Tool to extract and organize Kindle highlights by book into separate files.

## Problem
Kindle generates a file, myclippings.txt, where it dumps highlights from all books that you read chronologically rather than by book, and adds long, unnecessary strings to your highlight bloating the content. I needed a way to quickly sort the highlights by book for future reference, and to erase KindleÂ´s additional metadata.

## Features
- Separates mixed highlights from multiple books that Kindle collects in myclippings.txt
- Creates individual files per book
- Handles both long quotes and individual vocabulary words
- Sorts highlights by page number
- Erases unnecessary and repetitive information from the invidivual highlights

## Development
Developed with assistance from Claude AI and Qwen AI for concept refinement and implementation.
